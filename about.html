            <p>Hi, I’m Kyle Jacobson, a sophomore at Iowa State University. I have experience with web development from learning 
                things on my own. A year ago, I started learning about HTML, CSS, then later about JS and the DOM APIs. I now hope to 
                learn about Javascript frameworks like React. I also have some experience working on the Backend side of things from
                 my time in COMS309. There, I worked on a Spring Boot backend, and also learned about version control technologies like 
                 Git and hosting technologies like Github.</p>

            <p>I’m Simon Berberich and I’m a junior at Iowa State majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Cyber Security Engineering.
                 I’ve worked with the java and C programming languages to code smaller projects in the past. Prior to this class I’d not had 
                 much experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript, but I’ve been enjoying the material taught in this class and have taken it 
                 upon myself to expand my knowledge outside of class as well. I look forward to applying the material learned in this class
                in the real world upon graduating.</p>

        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <div class="child-2">
            <h1>ComS 319 Construction of User Interaces, Spring 2024</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Our purpose is to make it easier for chess players to gain critical information about their friends and enemies in a 
                more streamlined and efficient way. The free chess website, lichess.org, provides many API endpoints for learning about its 
                players. For example, we provide a more streamlined method of accessing someone’s ratings. Currently, to search for a 
                player’s rating, a user would have to navigate away from their homepage, find the search bar, and enter their name. 
                This process requires navigating the complex UI of Lichess and loading more information than necessary. 
                To streamline this process, we created a simple search bar to allow users to type in a name and access that user’s ratings, 
                all on the same page. This saves the end user time and bandwidth. We provide the same service for many other endpoints of 
                Lichess, including for a user’s online status, activity, and performance.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>-Provide a simpler, more streamlined approach to access Lichess’s user data<br/>
                -Learn about web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS <br/>
                -Learn about fundamental Web APIS like DOM and Fetch<br/>
                -Gain a working knowledge of important version control programs like Git and Github for hosting<br/>
                -Gain important experience for the Final project<br/>
            </p>
            <h2>Resources Used</h2>
